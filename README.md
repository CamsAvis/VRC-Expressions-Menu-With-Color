# VRC-Expressions-Menu-With-Color
Gives users the ability to easily set and change the color of the text on their expressions menu

In order for this editor to take effect, you will have to remove VRC's old VRCExpressionsMenuEditor.cs.<br>
This can usually be found under:<br>
`Assets\VRCSDK\SDK3A\Editor\Components3\VRCExpressionsMenuEditor.cs`
